# Changelog v1.5.6

## Fixed

- **Activity Intensity Heatmap**: Fixed an issue where the heatmap would only display rows for days with activity data, causing "Last 7 Days" to show fewer than 7 days (e.g., only Mon-Fri). The heatmap now correctly displays a full 7-day grid, filling missing days with empty data.
